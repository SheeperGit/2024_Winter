# CSCC24 Exercise 6 - $\lambda$, map, filter, fold

Heya, I'm Sean Shekhtman! 
This is the README for CSCC24's Exercise 6 on lambda expressions, map, filter, and fold.


## Files

- map.c
- lambda.cpp
- map.cpp
- filter.cpp
- fold.cpp

## Prerequisites
- A C compiler [Optional - We will use gcc] (Only for running map.c)
- A C++ compiler [Required - We will use g++]

# How to Run the Code

If the file extension is `.c`, then perform the following steps:
- Download `my_c_file.c`
- Open up a terminal and navigate to the directory which you've installed `my_c_file.c`
- Type: gcc `my_c_file.c`
	- If you're on a Linux machine, type: `./a.out`
	- If you're on a Windows machine, type: `./a.exe`

If the file extension is `.cpp`, then perform the following steps:
- Download `my_cpp_file.cpp`
- Open up a terminal and navigate to the directory which you've installed `my_cpp_file.cpp`
- Type: g++ `my_cpp_file.cpp`
	- If you're on a Linux machine, type: `./a.out`
	- If you're on a Windows machine, type: `./a.exe`
